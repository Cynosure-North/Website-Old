I wasn't really sure what I was in for when I saw Hole. What I got was a rich exploration of the way personal relationships can spill into the wider world.
The play follows Stella, an atmospheric scientist investigating the recent ozone hole. Her relationships with Greenpeace expedition leader Bonny, and Ioane the Navy Seal charged with keeping the Americans in line. Unfortunately that's 90% of their character. The combination of the writing and the performances is just short of that magic line where they come alive. Be it Ioane's accent slipping a touch, or the designated 2 quirks for side characters and 3 for Stella. That being said, that doesn't stay a problem for too long. The relationships between characters are excellent. They're funny and tense, and it evolves fluidly. 
The narrative is well written, and has a lot to say. It deftly slots the characters in between massive issue, and lets them crash together. This especially potent between Stella and Betty, considering the recent destruction of the Rainbow Warrior. Similarly the way Stella and Ioane's relationship blossoms shows the way the machinations of those with nothing to lose come between human connection. I think my favorite dynamic is the one between Bonny and Ioane though. Their interactions are always exciting, and they address powerful issues around how we deal with generational trauma, and our responsibilities to each other.
Overall, I really enjoyed my time with Hole. While it does have issues, they mostly fade away within half an hour, leaving an engaging tale of connection on the most isolated continent.
