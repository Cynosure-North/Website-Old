Perhaps I'm too youong to geth the humour, maybe it went way over my head and I'm going to look like a fool as soon as I publish this. I now understand the bravery it requires to get on stage with that as your set.
I can see myself enjoying this around a dinner with friends and family, as everyone is a little drunk and full, and only half paying attention. That is the ideal time to whip out an hour of mediocre puns and tragic singing in a piercing and semi-humerous accent. However I enjoy it less when I have to pay to enter, and I don't even get food from it.
The jokes are worth half a chuckle, at best. The music is ruined by singing thats InTeNtiOnAlY bAd So YoU CaN't CrItIcIsE iT. I am, it's bad, and it's not helped by repeating the same jokes multiple times.
